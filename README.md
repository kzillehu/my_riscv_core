# My RISC-V Core Processor



## Getting started

A Simplified RISC-V processor implemented to for a few instructions. 

## Issues
There were issues with the two files: sample code and sum array, that SW function was not working as expected. 

These issues were resolved by Steve by updating assembler and shell library. The new file, m5_sum_array contains the updated shell library, and linked to updated assembler and my code for summing first five elements of an array.

## Working 
m5_summ_array has working code for summing first five elements of array a.

Trying to init DMem with array elements prior to running program code.
